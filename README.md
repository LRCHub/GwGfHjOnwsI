[00:13.00] All I know is
[00:16.13] We could go anywhere, we could do
[00:18.85] Anything, girl, whatever the mood we're in
[00:23.70] Yeah, all I know is
[00:27.02] Gettin' lost late at night, under stars
[00:29.72] Findin' love standin' right where we are, your lips
[00:55.22] 
[00:33.95] They pull me in the moment
[00:36.82] You and I alone, and
[00:39.56] People may be watching
[00:42.30] I don't mind 'cause
[00:51.80] 
[00:46.59] Anywhere with you feels right
[00:49.05] Anywhere with you feels like
[00:51.88] Paris in the rain
[00:54.49] Paris in the rain
[01:02.99] 
[00:57.25] We don't need a fancy town
[00:59.74] Or bottles that we can't pronounce
[01:02.44] 'Cause anywhere, babe
[01:04.94] Is like Paris in the rain
[01:17.44] 
[01:07.64] When I'm with you
[01:10.38] When I'm with you
[01:13.54] Paris in the rain
[01:16.42] Paris in the rain
[01:24.92] 
[01:19.08] I look at you now and I want this forever
[01:21.92] I might not deserve it, but there's nothing better
[01:24.32] Don't know how I ever did it all without you
[01:27.24] My heart is about to, about to jump out of my chest
[01:52.74] 
[01:30.66] Feelings they come and they go, that they do
[01:33.47] Feelings they come and they go, not with you
[01:36.19] Late nights and the street lights
[01:37.38] And the people, look at me girl
[01:38.72] And the whole world could stop
[01:53.72] 
[01:40.82] Anywhere with you feels right
[01:43.68] Anywhere with you feels like
[01:46.28] Paris in the rain
[01:49.10] Paris in the rain
[01:57.60] 
[01:51.90] We don't need a fancy town
[01:54.46] Or bottles that we can't pronounce
[01:57.13] 'Cause anywhere, babe
[01:59.46] Is like Paris in the rain
[02:11.96] 
[02:02.22] When I'm with you
[02:04.75] When I'm with you
[02:08.05] Paris in the rain
[02:10.88] Paris in the rain
[02:19.38] 
[02:19.07] Girl, when I'm not with you
[02:21.96] All I do is miss you
[02:31.96] 
[02:29.97] So come and set the mood right
[02:32.76] Underneath the moonlight
[02:36.12] Days in Paris, nights in Paris
[02:41.01] Paint you with my eyes closed
[02:55.51] 
[02:43.75] Wonder where the time goes
[02:47.54] Yeah, isn't it obvious? Isn't it obvious?
[02:52.28] Come and set the mood right
[02:54.75] Underneath the moonlight
[03:06.75] 
[02:57.39] Anywhere with you feels right
[02:59.92] Anywhere with you feels like
[03:03.08] Paris in the rain
[03:05.73] Paris in the rain
[03:14.23] 
[03:08.68] Walking down an empty street
[03:11.85] Puddles underneath our feet
