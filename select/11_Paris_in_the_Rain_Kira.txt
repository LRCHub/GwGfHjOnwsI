All I know is
We could go anywhere, we could do
Anything, girl, whatever the mood we're in
Yeah, all I know is
Getting lost late at night under stars
Finding love standing right where we are
Your lips, they pull me in the moment
You and I alone and
People may be watching, I don't mind

'Cause anywhere with you feels right
Anywhere with you feels like Paris in the rain, Paris in the rain
We don't need a fancy town or bottles that we can't pronounce
'Cause anywhere babe is like Paris in the rain
When I'm with you, when I'm with you
Paris in the rain, Paris in the rain

I look at you now and I want this forever
I might not deserve it but there's nothing better
Don't know how I ever did it all without you
My heart is about to, about to jump out of my chest
Feelings, they come and they go, that they do
Feelings, they come and they go, not with you
The late nights and the street lights and the people
Look at me girl and the whole world could stop

Anywhere with you feels right
Anywhere with you feels like Paris in the rain, Paris in the rain
We don't need a fancy town or bottles that we can't pronounce
'Cause anywhere babe is like Paris in the rain
When I'm with you, when I'm with you
Paris in the rain, Paris in the rain, oh

Girl when I'm not with you
All I do is miss you
So come and set the mood right underneath the moonlight
Days in Paris, nights in Paris
Paint you with my eyes closed
Wonder where the time goes
(Isn't it obvious?)
(Isn't it obvious?)
So come and set the mood right underneath the moonlight

'Cause anywhere with you feel right
Anywhere with you feels like Paris in the rain, Paris in the rain
Walking down an empty street
Puddles underneath our feet
