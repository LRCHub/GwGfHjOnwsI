I've been searching every nightclub
From Marais to Montparnasse
Clouds above are crying
I'm a stranger you can trust
Heartaches I'm escaping
Love that's gone insane
Fountains heal the heartache

Paris in the rain
Paris in the rain
Menage a trois
Paris in the rain
Paris in the rain
Menage a trois

Where I love to love you
Where I love to love you
Where I love to love you
Where I love to love you

Catwalk something Gaultier
Looking sharp in a McQueen
Dior Galliano
Share the glamour of the scene
But seasons have an ending
And the glamour was in vain
Fountains heal the heartache

Paris in the rain
Paris in the rain
Menage a trois
Paris in the rain
Paris in the rain
Menage a trois
Where I love to love you
Where I love to love you
Where I love to love you
Where I love to love you

Menage a trois
Menage a trois

Sailing through ovations
At a fashion year's awards
Then she's crying to the airport
From Place de la Concorde
It's a city built on romance
Love that's gone insane
Fountains heal the heartache

Paris in the rain
Paris in the rain
Menage a trois
Paris in the rain
Paris in the rain
Menage a trois

Where I love to love you
Where I love to love you
Where I love to love you
Where I love to love you

Paris in the rain
Paris in the rain
Menage a trois
Paris in the rain
Paris in the rain
Menage a trois
